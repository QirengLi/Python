Characteristics of Two pointers

1.) Two moving pointers, regardless of directions, moving dependently or independently;
2.) A function that utilizes the entries referenced by the two pointers, which relates to the answer in a way;
3.) An easy way of deciding which pointer to move;
4.) A way to process the array when the pointers are moved.




Basic Template

left = 0
right = len(nums) - 1

while left < right:
    ... default/base case to return answer

    ... if statements condition/comparison
            left += 1
    ... elif or else condition
            right -= 1


Slow and Fast pointer -- See "AM Remove Duplicates"

Slow pointer only moves when a condition is met. Usually fast pointer is the one doing the checking and comparing
to the slow pointer.

slow = 0
for fast in range(len(nums)):
    ... if statement
            change slow pointer
