# Above is a slightly more optimized solution
# main difference lies in the 2nd for loop where if the value/count of the character is at 1
# it will remove it from the dictionary. Then we can check the length of the dictionary to see if
# it's empty.

# Below function doesn't remove anything from the dictionary but instead, subtracts the count
# of the chars and then checks all the values to see if it equals 0
